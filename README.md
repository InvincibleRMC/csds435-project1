# Algorithm Descripions

## Nearest Neighbor

## Decision Tree

## Naïve Bayes

## SVM

## Neural Network

Uses scikit-learn to train a simple classifier. Then evaluates the classifier.

# Data Preprocessing

For data preprocessing we used scikit-learn's `StandardScaler` to remove the mean and scale to the unit variance.

# Methods and Results

## Nearest Neighbor

## Decision Tree

## Naïve Bayes

## SVM

## Neural Network

For determining hyperparameter we used `GridSearchCV` to evaluate diferent parameters. To see the optomized parameters check them out in `neural_network.py`. For data set 1 the default stores almost optomized so the improvement is not great. In data set 2 the accuracies are about the same but, precision, recall, and F1 are much higher.
